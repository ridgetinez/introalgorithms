Find a peak in Circular Arrays

A circular array have A[0] and A[n-1] as neighbours. Design an O(lgn) algorithm for peak finding in a circular array.

1) Suppose we know the values of A[0], A[k], A[k+1] and A[n-1] for 1 < k < n - 1. Considering the maximum value among the four cells, in which (circular) sub-array would you be guaranteed to find a peak? (4 Points)



2) Using the divide routine suggested in previous part, design a divide-and-conquer algorithm that returns a peak of circular arrays of size n in O(lgn) (6 Points)
